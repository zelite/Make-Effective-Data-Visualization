    <h2>Handedness of Baseball Players</h2>
    <p>Around 10% of the world population is left-handed [1], however we
    see a much higher proportion of left-handed inviduals playing baseball.
    From a sample of 891 baseball players, we see that around 60% are right handed,
    almost 30% are left handed and 10% are ambidextrous. Do left-handed
    players perform better at this sport?</p>

  <div id="avg-boxplot" class="story-text">
    <h2>Batting Average by Handedness</h2>
    <p>The batting average is baseball statistic which is defined by the number
      of hits divided by at bats. [2] We can see that the median batting average
      of left-handed players is higher than right-handed and ambidextrous players.
      <br>
      We can also observe that the box for the left-handed players is smaller
      (smaller interquartile range) which means the left-handed players have
      less variability in their batting average. However, the two highest performers
      are left-handed.

    <h2>Home Runs by Handedness</h2>
    <p>In Baseball an home run is when a batter hits the ball over the edge of
      the field and then is able to score a point by reaching home safely. A less
      common type of home run is called a <em>inside-the-par home run</em>. This
      is when the batter is able to circle all the bases without being  put out by
      the fielders of the opposite team. [3]
      <br>
      Once again we can see that left-handed players have a median number of home runs
      higher than the other players. We can see that in all classes of players
      the 3rd Quartile of all player classes is always more far away from the median
      than the 1st Quartile. This shows that the distrution of number of home runs
      is positively skewed. This comes from the natural minimum of zero home runs
      on the lower end of the distribution, which is where the majority of players lie.

    <h2>What's in the Handedness?</h2>
    Are left-handed people more athletic? Why do they tend to perform better in
    baseball and why are they present in higher proportion than in the general
    population? The short answer: baseball is built for lefties [4].

    <blockquote cite="http://www.livescience.com/2665-baseball-rigged-lefties.html">
      <b>The ballparks:</b> Right field in most parks is shorter than left field
      because of the preponderance of right-handed hitters.
      <br>

<b>Seeing the ball:</b> "A right-handed batter facing a right-handed pitcher actually
has to pick up the ball visually as it comes from behind his (the batter's) left
shoulder. The left-handed batter facing the right-handed pitcher has the ball
coming to him, so he has a much clearer view of pitches."
<br>
<b>Getting going:</b> After a right-hander connects with a ball, his momentum spins him
toward the third-base side. He must regroup to take even his first step toward
first base. A left-hander's momentum carries him directly toward first. "The
left-handed batter has a 5-foot advantage over the right-handed batter," Peters
calculates. "And that means the lefty travels the 90 feet to first roughly
one-sixth of a second faster than the righty. That translates to more base hits
for the left-hander, whether singles or extra base hits because lefties are
getting to the bases more quickly."
